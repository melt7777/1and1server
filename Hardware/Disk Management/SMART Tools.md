# Self-Monitoring, Analysis and Reporting Technology System (SMART) Tools

## Installing Smartmontools
Smartmontools should be installed by default on most 1&1 images. If the smartctl command isn't available for any reason it can be installed with the following commands:

Debian: `apt-get install smartmontools`  
CentOS: `yum install smartmontools`

## Smartctl CLI and S.M.A.R.T. Attributes

The Smartmontools package and the smartctl command line tool provides an interface to a disksâ€™ firmware and specifically to read the SMART data generated and stored by the drive. As long as we know the block device location in the file system, we can get the disk information using the following command

`[root@localhost ~]# smartctl [options] device`

### Getting all information
Although all the below information and some additional information is available when passing just the `-a` option it's good to understand the information we see in each section and know how to run additional tests if needed.

### Showing drive info
The drive information can be shown by throwing the `-i` option of smartctl and specifying the drive to check. For example, we see the following information for the `/dev/sda` drive. This tells us the drive manufacturer and serial number as well as other information related to the drive hardware.

```
rescue:~# smartctl -i /dev/sda

=== START OF INFORMATION SECTION ===  
Model Family:     Seagate Barracuda 7200.14 (AF)  
Device Model:     ST1000DM003-1SB102

LU WWN Device Id: 5 000c50 09bd58959  
Firmware Version: CC43
User Capacity:    1,000,204,886,016 bytes [1.00 TB]
Sector Sizes:     512 bytes logical, 4096 bytes physical
Rotation Rate:    7200 rpm

ATA Version is:   ATA8-ACS T13/1699-D revision 4
SATA Version is:  SATA 3.0, 6.0 Gb/s (current: 3.0 Gb/s)

SMART support is: Available - device has SMART capability.
SMART support is: Disabled
```

We can see the drive manufacturer and model under Model Family: as well as the Serial Number: which is why this information is needed to replace the drive. Also, in this example (last line), we can see that the SMART support is available but currently disabled. We'll need to enable SMART support before we can check the stats for this drive or run any tests on it.

### Enable/Disable SMART support
To enable SMART support, the `-s {{on|off}}` option/value can be used to enable or disable.
```
rescue:~# smartctl -s on /dev/sda
smartctl 6.4 2014-10-07 r4002 [x86_64-linux-3.10.104] (local build)
Copyright (C) 2002-14, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org

=== START OF ENABLE/DISABLE COMMANDS SECTION ===
SMART Enabled.
```

Now that SMART status is enabled, we can look at the SMART data that's been collected and the overall health of the drive.

### Showing overall health of drive
To show just the overall health of the drive, the `-H` option can be passed to `smartctl`.
```
rescue:~# smartctl -H /dev/sdb
smartctl 6.4 2014-10-07 r4002 [x86_64-linux-3.10.104] (local build)
Copyright (C) 2002-14, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org

=== START OF READ SMART DATA SECTION ===
SMART overall-health self-assessment test result: PASSED
```

### Running SMART self-test
If anything appears out of range in the SMART data, we can force the drive to run a short or long self-test by passing the `-t {{short|long}}` option to `smartctl`. This will trigger an immediate scan of the drive. This can be run while the live system is running but will cause additional disk IO and may affect performance. A short test will typically take a few minutes while a long test may take a few hours on a 1TB drive.
```
rescue:~# smartctl -t short /dev/sda
smartctl 6.4 2014-10-07 r4002 [x86_64-linux-3.10.104] (local build)
Copyright (C) 2002-14, Bruce Allen, Christian Franke, www.smartmontools.org

=== START OF OFFLINE IMMEDIATE AND SELF-TEST SECTION ===

Testing has begun.
Please wait 1 minutes for test to complete.

```
Both short and long tests will tell us the estimated time for the test to complete. In these scenarios, it's about a minute for a short test and almost two hours for a long test.
```
rescue:~# smartctl -t long /dev/sda
smartctl 6.4 2014-10-07 r4002 [x86_64-linux-3.10.104] (local build)

```

### Reading SMART self-test results
To read the results of a self-test, we can pass the `-l selftest` option. If a test is currently running, we will also see the remaining percentage of the test.  If a test completes with errors, we know that the drive needs to be replaced immediately. If the drive is behind a Software or Hardware RAID then we shouldn't immediately need to worry about any lost data since the RAID rebuild will copy the data over to the replaced drive if the other RAID disks are in good health.

```
rescue:~# smartctl -l selftest /dev/sda

```

### Reading SMART errors
Since we can just replace the dead or dying drive in a RAID array and rebuild it, we rarely need to look at the actual errors on a drive. If we ever need to, the `-l error` option will show us the errors that have been logged and is a good place to start when trying to recover lost or corupted data.
```
rescue:~# smartctl -l error /dev/sda

### Getting SMART data
We can view the data attributes and values using the `-A` option for `smartctl`. The primary data field we look at is the Reallocated Sectors indicated by the highlighted section in the example below. The important attributes are detailed after the break. Many of the values we see for certain attributes are not useful to us in any way. Additionally, some manufacturers report these values in non-standard ways so it's generally safe to ignore them. For example, the Seek_Error_Rate  value on this Seagate drive is 3859636 which looks like a high value but in reality, it's not indicating a problem on this drive.
```

| SMART Attribute Name	| Description |
| --------------------- |:-----------:|
| Reallocated_Sector_Ct	| Bad sectors of the drive that were successfully read and replaced with new sectors. The OS does not see these sectors anymore and they cannot affect the OS. Think of these as sectors that the drive has trashed and substituted with other sectors that weren't being used. Even a high number of these reallocated sectors does not indicate it's the cause of problems but it does indicate the drive is beginning to fail. Other attributes will cause errors.
| Command_Timeout	| The number of operations that timed out and were aborted by the disk firmware. This generally might indicate a problem with the SATA/SCSI cabling. It's not a common error but something to be aware of.
| Current_Pending_Sector | Similar to Reallocated sectors but the firmware was unable to read the data in the sector and was unable to seamlessly copy the data to a good sector and trash the old one. As these sectors are still "visible" to the OS, they can cause problems and you may see corrupted data on the disk. These errors would need to be manually corrected through OS tools.
| Offline_Uncorrectable	| General error message indicating uncorrectable errors when reading/writing a sector.

### Getting SMART stats for a drive behind Hardware RAID
If a hardware RAID controller is being used, we need to provide `smartctl` the RAID driver and the RAID endpoint so that we access the drive directly and can request the SMART attribute values. We could also use the RAID driver through CLI and then request the SMART attributes for each drive but I find it easiest to use `smartctl` any time we are looking for SMART attributes. The RAID driver is provided with the `-d [3ware,#|areca,#]` option. Since the raw device we provide to `smartctl` this time is the hardware controller, we need to provide the disk number as `,#` after the driver.
```
